# libmagic
a data model for Magic The Gathering game

it covers most of the things to represent the state of a MTG card game and MTG decks 

# TODO
- Color needs redesign
- Abilities (model, not rules)
- more nuts and bolts for a basic rules engine (e.g: matchers for battlefield and other zones)
- API for external control (to be used by embedded LUA, Python or JS scripts for card abilities)
